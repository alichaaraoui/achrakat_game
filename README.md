Brief:
Achrakat is a serene exploration game where players step into the role of a young student-explorer uncovering the remnants of an ancient, once-united kingdom. Guided by a mysterious dreamlike figure named Layali, you traverse breathtaking landscapes inspired by Lebanese and Levantine architecture, gathering sacred light energy from water, flora, and relics to unlock the power of gliding.

Each region reveals forgotten cities and cultural wonders, where reviving bridges, temples, and connections is key to progression. The journey is one of architectural discovery, environmental storytelling, and gentle puzzle-solving â€” a meditative adventure about reconnection, heritage, and the beauty of a world slowly coming back to life.
